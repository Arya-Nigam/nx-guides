    "## Introduction\n",
    "A graph is said to be **planar** if it can be drawn on a plane without any of its edges crossing. The `check_planarity` function in NetworkX helps determine whether a given graph is planar and provides either an embedding or a counterexample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Background\n",
    "A graph is **planar** if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to **K₅ (complete graph on 5 vertices)** or **K₃,₃ (complete bipartite graph with partition sizes 3 and 3)**. This is known as **Kuratowski’s theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The planarity check in NetworkX is based on the **Left-Right Planarity Test**, an efficient combinatorial method to determine planarity."

    "Main article: Rotation system\n",
    "An embedded graph uniquely defines cyclic orders of edges incident to the same vertex. The set of all these cyclic orders is called a rotation system. Embeddings with the same rotation system are considered to be equivalent and the corresponding equivalence class of embeddings is called combinatorial embedding (as opposed to the term topological embedding, which refers to the previous definition in terms of points and curves). Sometimes, the rotation system itself is called a \"combinatorial embedding\".[5][6][7]\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedded graph also defines natural cyclic orders of edges which constitutes the boundaries of the faces of the embedding. However handling these face-based orders is less straightforward, since in some cases some edges may be traversed twice along a face boundary. For example this is always the case for embeddings of trees, which have a single face. To overcome this combinatorial nuisance, one may consider that every edge is \"split\" lengthwise in two \"half-edges\", or \"sides\". Under this convention in all face boundary traversals each half-edge is traversed only once and the two half-edges of the same edge are always traversed in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other equivalent representations for cellular embeddings include the ribbon graph, a topological space formed by gluing together topological disks for the vertices and edges of an embedded graph, and the graph-encoded map, an edge-colored cubic graph with four vertices for each edge of the embedded graph."

    "## Neighbor ordering:\n",
    "In comparison to a usual graph structure, the embedding also stores the order of all neighbors for every vertex. The order of the neighbors can be given in clockwise (cw) direction or counterclockwise (ccw) direction. This order is stored as edge attributes in the underlying directed graph. For the edge (u, v) the edge attribute ‘cw’ is set to the neighbor of u that follows immediately after v in clockwise direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a PlanarEmbedding to be valid it must fulfill multiple conditions. It is possible to check if these conditions are fulfilled with the method check_structure(). The conditions are:\n",
    "1. Edges must go in both directions (because the edge attributes differ)\n",
    "2. Every edge must have a ‘cw’ and ‘ccw’ attribute which corresponds to a correct planar embedding.\n",

    "2. connect_components()\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the graph is a subclass of nx.DiGraph, it can still be used for algorithms that require undirected graphs, because the method is_directed() is overridden. This is possible, because a valid PlanarGraph must have edges in both directions.\n",

    "In methods like add_half_edge the term “half-edge” is used, which is a term that is used in doubly connected edge lists. It is used to emphasize that the edge is only in one direction and there exists another half-edge in the opposite direction. While conventional edges always have two faces (including outer face) next to them, it is possible to assign each half-edge exactly one face. For a half-edge (u, v) that is oriented such that u is below v then the face that belongs to (u, v) is to the right of this half-edge."
